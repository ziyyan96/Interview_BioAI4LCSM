# Breast Cancer Subtype Analysis with LLMs, Multi-Omics & Machine Learning

This repository contains a modular pipeline integrating clinical data, gene expression analysis, classical machine learning, and large language models (LLMs) for breast cancer subtype classification and interpretability.

## üî¨ Project Overview

We aim to systematically investigate breast cancer heterogeneity across subtypes (LumA, LumB, Basal, Her2, Normal) using:

- **Gene expression data (microarray/RNA-seq)**
- **Clinical variables (ER/PR/HER2/Ki67, tumor size, survival, etc.)**
- **Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques**
- **LLM-driven literature mining for gene-function and method identification**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods Used

### üí° Subtype Classification

- **Supervised**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)
- **Unsupervised**: KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, GMM, Spectral Clustering
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, Autoencoder, t-SNE, UMAP

### üß† LLM Integration

- PubMed search via Biopython (Entrez)
- Method extraction with `falcon-rw-1b`, `BioGPT`, and instruction-following LLMs
- Technique matching using keyword vocabularies + fuzzy logic

### üß¨ Gene-Level Interpretation

- limma for differential expression
- Subtype-wise up/downregulated gene sets
- Pathway annotations via MyGene.info API

### üìà Clinical Modeling

- Statistical testing (Chi-square, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis)
- Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier, Cox models)
- Treatment prediction models (logistic regression, FFNN)

## üìä Sample Results

- Supervised models achieved **up to 87% accuracy** in subtype classification.
- Unsupervised clustering yielded low ARI/NMI, indicating challenges in latent subtype discovery.
- LLM-assisted literature mining extracts context-aware insights on gene roles and ML techniques from PubMed abstracts.
- Clinical variable significance aligns with known subtype biology (e.g., LumA ‚Üí high ER, low Ki67; Basal ‚Üí triple-negative, high proliferation).
- CNAttention model achieved **~95% accuracy**, highlighting the power of attention-based MIL in modeling gene expression.
